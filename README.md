# Numerical Linear Algebra Exercises (MATLAB and Python implementation)

This repository contains small but functional MATLAB and Python scripts implementing core
numerical linear algebra algorithms. These programs were developed as part of
practice exercises and serve as clean, working examples of the methods they
represent.

## Contents

- Eigen decomposition via the power, reverse iteration and QR methods.
- Experimental testing and analysis of numerical methods.
- Gramâ€“Schmidt orthogonalization.
- QR decomposition using Householder reflections.
- Krylov subspace method for solving linear systems.
- Successive Over-Relaxation method for solving linear systems.

## Requirements

- MATLAB or Python

## Usage

Please don't use these scripts. These implementations are purely for educational
purposes and are not optimized for performance or robustness.

## Comments

Comments in the code are in Croatian. Although scripts are so small that
comments are pretty much irrelevant.
